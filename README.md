# Atliq-promo-performance-analysis
# Project Background
AtliQ Mart is one of South India’s leading retail supermarket chains, operating over 50 stores across major cities and emerging urban locations.

During Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024, the company ran large-scale promotions across all 50 stores on its in-house branded products to capitalize on festive demand. With multiple promo types running across varied categories and locations, the Sales Director now needs clear insights into which promotions delivered meaningful lift—and which fell short—to guide future campaign decisions.This project thoroughly analyzes the promotion data—helping the sales leadership evaluate what worked, what didn’t, and how to optimize future campaigns.

The analysis provides deep insights and recommendations across the following key areas:

- **Store-Level Analysis:** Identifying top- and low-performing stores and cities during festive campaigns.
- **Promotion Performance:** Measuring uplift in revenue and units sold across different promotion types.
- **Product & Category Insights:** Understanding which categories and products responded best to promotions.
